For this task we'll be using the same Diabetic Retinopathy data set which was used in the previous assignment on decision trees. The implementation details are up to you but, generally it is a good idea to divide your code up into helper functions."

    "Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier that is based on applying the Bayes' theorem and assumes a strong (naive) independence between features. The Diabetic Retinopathy data set contains both categorical and continuous features. Dealing with categorical features has been discussed in detail in class. Continuous attributes, on the other hand, are more interesting to handle. Most commonly, this is done by assuming normal probability distribution over the feature values or by binning the attribute values in a fixed number of bins. In this assignment you'll be implementing the binning approach. For each continuous attribute, you'll construct 3 equal sized bins. For example, feature 5 ranges from `[1 - 120]` the 3 bins that you'll construct will be `[1 - 40]`, `[41 - 80]`, `[81 - 120]`."

    "The distance calculation method is central to the algorithm, typically Euclidean distance is used but other distance metrics like Manhattan distance can also be used. In this assignment you'll be implementing the classifier using the Euclidean distance metric. It is important to note that Euclidean distance is very sensitive to the scaling of different attributes hence, before you can build your classifier you have to normalize the values of each feature in the data set."
